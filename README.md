### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am Yazhou Tang, a senior student in SJTU, majored in Computer Science.

:seedling: I'm currently learning **programming languages** and **formal verification**, and doing something about [VST](https://github.com/PrincetonUniversity/VST).

:dart: I'm preparing for **National Postgraduate Entrance Examination** this year.

:star: I believe that **All is well**, and **everything will be better**.

:bulb: I'm curious about some interesting things, such as compilers and program analysis.
